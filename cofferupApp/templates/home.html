<div class="welcome-text">
    <p>Coff'ErUp is a place where you can create and maintain digital collection coffers.</p>
    <p>There are several types of coffers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Open Coffers - Coffers that have already started and are accepting contributions/penalties
        <li> Future Coffers - Coffers that have been created but the start date has not arrived
        <li> Closed Coffers - Coffers whose end date has passed
        <ul>
            <li> Settled - Closed Coffers that have been Paid
            <li> Unsettled - Closed Coffers that are Unpaid
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Multiple users can contribute to multiple coffers.</p>
    <p>So get started and join your friends in filling the coffers.</p> {% endcomment %}
